# Session 1
## TypeScript (I)

This is the example code from session 1. The individual files are described below

### How I Code
In this section, you can see examples of my coding style. It's not too unusual among professional JavaScript/TypeScript programmers.

This section may also refresh some of the things you have forgotten from WEB2.

* `arrow functions.ts` A simple example of writing functions using =>
* `spread.ts` How to use the spread operator (...) with arrays and objects
* `destructuring.ts` An elegant way of extracting information from arrays and objects. Also works in parameter declarations, though that is not shown.
* `map filter reduce.ts` An example of how to use the classic array methods.
* `interface+object literal.ts` How to create objects without classes using interfaces and object literals.
* `higher order functions.ts` Creating your own higher order functions.

### TypeScript
Demonstration of various TypeScript concepts. Some of this you may already know.

* `basics.ts` A simple type error, and how to work around it using `any`.
* `object type vs interface.ts` An object type and an interface. The point is that they are the same thing (except one weird interface feature).
* `subtype.ts` Everybody knows this works, but why?
* `intersection.ts` A simple example of intersection types.
* `narrowing.ts` An example of how type narrowing works in TypeScript, and a case where it isn't so easy to use.
* `discriminated unions.ts` The standard way of making narrowing work if you have unions of object types.
